# Phase_2
This is phase two of the prototyping berry project. It utilizes the Berry IDE and the berries on the vine to make prototyping easy. We aim to make this process as simple as possible.

Using a simple Gui that imports pictures of physical devices and then runs some image processing on them they can me tethered to the code.

This coupling of the Physical and the digital is aimed to help in developemnt of physical devices. Seeing a physical representation clicking on that object and programming it strengthens the connection.


Installations for the Various files and libraries will be posted soon. The Berry network has to be install, python 3, PyQt5, cv2. pretty minimal installs, perhaprs we can make an install zip when we are closer to that point.
